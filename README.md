A minimalist, privacy-friendly Chrome extension that always displays a QR code in the corner of your browser window.

Perfect for streamers who use a web browser while streaming!

The following settings can be adjusted from the popup window:
  - Enable/disable extension
  - Change QR code image size

## How to Use

After installing the extension, a QR code will appear on the bottom-right corner of every URL you visit. If the URL changes, the QR code will be regenerated.

While the mouse is hovering over the QR code, it will become transparent so you can see the content beneath it.

If you click on the QR code, it will disappear for a short period so you can click/interact with any content underneath it.

### Options

#### Enable this Extension

If this option is set to 'Yes', every page you visit will have a QR code in the corner of the screen.

If this option is set to 'No', then you will not see any QR codes on the screen until you re-enable the option.

#### Image size

You can adjust the size of the QR code by changing this setting.

## Privacy

All data is rendered entirely within the browser. This extension does not contact any servers or make any network connections.

## Acknowledgments

This project uses [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) for its QR code rendering.
