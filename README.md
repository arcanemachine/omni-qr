# Omni QR Code Viewer

A minimalist, privacy-friendly Chrome extension that always displays a QR code in the corner of your browser window.

Perfect for streamers who use a web browser while streaming!

## Privacy

All data is rendered entirely within the browser. This extension does not contact any servers or make any network connections.

## Acknowledgments

This project uses [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) for its QR code rendering.
